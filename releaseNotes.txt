Release Notes for MQCPack

This file is meant to document key functionality changes developers
implement within MQCPack and push into our public repositories. Whenever
the list of new/modified/changes features/options becomes meaningful, Hrant
(hhratchian@ucmerced.edu) will update the version numbers. Such version
number updates will be documented here. Note that the minor version number
will often be updated near the start of the month and the revision number
in that case will be set to 0.
